.SH Members
.IP "mp" 12
Maximum Power indicates the sustained maximum power consumed by the
NVM subsystem in this power state. The power in Watts is equal to
the value in this field multiplied by the scale specified in the Max
Power Scale bit (see \fIenum nvme_psd_flags\fP). A value of 0 indicates
Maximum Power is not reported.
.IP "flags" 12
Additional decoding flags, see \fIenum nvme_psd_flags\fP.
.IP "enlat" 12
Entry Latency indicates the maximum latency in microseconds
associated with entering this power state. A value of 0 indicates
Entry Latency is not reported.
.IP "exlat" 12
Exit Latency indicates the maximum latency in microseconds
associated with exiting this power state. A value of 0 indicates
Exit Latency is not reported.
.IP "rrt" 12
Relative Read Throughput indicates the read throughput rank
associated with this power state relative to others. The value in
this is less than the number of supported power states.
.IP "rrl" 12
Relative Reade Latency indicates the read latency rank associated
with this power state relative to others. The value in this field is
less than the number of supported power states.
.IP "rwt" 12
Relative Write Throughput indicates write throughput rank associated
with this power state relative to others. The value in this field is
less than the number of supported power states
.IP "rwl" 12
Relative Write Latency indicates the write latency rank associated
with this power state relative to others. The value in this field is
less than the number of supported power states
.IP "idlp" 12
Idle Power indicates the typical power consumed by the NVM
subsystem over 30 seconds in this power state when idle.
.IP "ips" 12
Idle Power Scale indicates the scale for \fIstruct nvme_id_psd\fP.idlp,
see \fIenum nvme_psd_ps\fP for decoding this field.
.IP "actp" 12
Active Power indicates the largest average power consumed by the
NVM subsystem over a 10 second period in this power state with
the workload indicated in the Active Power Workload field.
.IP "apw" 12
Active Power Workload indicates the workload used to calculate
maximum power for this power state. See \fIenum nvme_psd_workload\fP for
decoding this field.
.IP "aps" 12
Active Power Scale indicates the scale for the \fIstruct
nvme_id_psd\fP.actp, see \fIenum nvme_psd_ps\fP for decoding this value.
