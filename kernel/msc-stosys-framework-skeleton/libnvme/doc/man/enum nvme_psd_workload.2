Extended Idle Period with a Burst of Random Write
consists of five minutes of idle followed by
thirty-two random write commands of size 1 MiB
submitted to a single controller while all other
controllers in the NVM subsystem are idle, and then
thirty (30) seconds of idle.
.IP "NVME_PSD_WORKLOAD_2" 12
Heavy Sequential Writes consists of 80,000
sequential write commands of size 128 KiB submitted to
a single controller while all other controllers in the
NVM subsystem are idle.  The submission queue(s)
should be sufficiently large allowing the host to
ensure there are multiple commands pending at all
times during the workload.
